# Mood Swings

When the user signs up or logs in the app, they will have an inspirational quote of the day. They will also have emojis to choose from, based on their mood. They will then click on their mood emoji and get funny, crazy, sad, romantic or angry gifs, or maybe a book or movie recommendation. 

## Motiviation

This has been one hell of a year and people have been affected by the pandemic in different ways. Some ae angry, sad but definitely CRAZY!. Others may be on a better path and are able to be happy with romance in the air!
